* SimplyRETS WP [[https://travis-ci.org/SimplyRETS/simplyretswp.svg?branch=master]]

  This is the official repository of the SimplyRETS Wordpress plugin
  client. SimplyRETS enables you to embed *your* live real estate listings
  directly on your site simply and easily.

  *[[http://wordpress-demo.simplyrets.com][Check out the demo site]]*

  The Wordpress plugin provides you a simply way to connect to your
  SimplyRETS account and start showing your real estate listings
  directly on your Wordpress site. It provides Wordpress standard
  custom post types, sidebard and footer widgets, shortcodes, and
  more.

  The plugin requires an active plan with SimplyRETS to enable /your/
  listings, but we also provide a demo test account with real listings
  that you can use to test out the plugin and make sure it does what
  you need it to.

  For any support related issues, you can:
  1) View the documentation at http://docs.simplyrets.com
